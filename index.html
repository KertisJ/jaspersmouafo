                        <div class="lp-block-text">
                            <p>I am a computer engineer with an academic background that I find intriguing, having pursued a Master's degree in Computer Civil Engineering from the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Prior to that, in 2019, I earned a Master's in Information Systems and Software Engineering from the Institut Universitaire de la Côte in Douala, Cameroon.</p>
    
                            <p>My passion for computer science extends beyond my education. In 2018, I co-founded a startup that transitioned into a simplified joint-stock company by 2020. Moreover, as an intern, I contributed to platform management at SMALS in 2022, where I adopted an agile work methodology. I also served as a tutor at ADMISTIS, guiding students in their studies in mathematics and computer science.</p> 
                            
                            <p>With every endeavor, my objective remains consistent: to deliver effective and innovative solutions in the field of computer science.</p>

                        <div class="lp-block-text">
                            <p>Beyond my passion for computing and my academic journey, I am first and foremost a man of many layers. One of my greatest joys in life is being the father of a wonderful little boy who is 2 and a half years old. Every day with him is a new adventure, a continuous learning experience, and an invaluable source of joy.</p>
    
                            <p>Those who know me will say that I'm a cheerful individual, always finding a reason to smile, even in the darkest moments. My sense of humor is contagious, and I like to believe that I often manage to brighten the day of those around me. I cherish the simple pleasures of daily life and firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine.</p>
                                
                            <p>Besides that, I enjoy spending time with my family, discovering new places with my son, and building memories that will last a lifetime. Family is my anchor, my source of inspiration, and the driving force that pushes me to always give my best, whether in my professional or personal life.</p>

                            <p>When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I find refuge and inspiration in cooking. It's an art that brings me as much satisfaction as crafting the perfect code.</p>
                            
                            <p>To relieve stress and rejuvenate, I lace up my running shoes for a refreshing run through the city. Basketball is another passion where I can unleash my competitive spirit.</p>
                            
                            <p> The captivating rhythms of salsa and bachata allow me to escape, while the gentle sound of my piano soothes me. And when I feel the urge to create something tangible, I turn to ceramics, molding and shaping clay to bring my ideas to life.</p>
